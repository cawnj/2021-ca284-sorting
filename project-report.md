## Introduction

Having completed the coding and analysis of the various algorithms it is now time to answer some questions on what you have found out from your efforts.  You have two alternatives below:

1. You may submit a written report.
2. You may submit a video.

choose the appropriate section below and follow the instructions which best suits your preferred way of expressing yourself.  You are reminded that this is _an individual project_.  You should refer to the DCU academic integrity policy, and also the resources shared as part of this module's website before submitting your report.

In either the video or written report, you are _expected_ to include Make sure to refer to your own code, and the data sets you have used.  For example, If you wish to illustrate a point you can say things like "refer to reverse-sorted-data.txt which can be found in the (folder-name) to see examples of ...".  Or: "See lines _x-y_ in file _myprogram.c_ to see an example of this".  this shows that your own data and code are being used to ilustrate and support the points you are making.

## Written Report

Please use either _Microsoft Word_ or _Markdown_ to prepare this report.  Your report should cover the content below.  Pay attention to word counts etc.  You should save the document in the _report_ folder of your gitlab repository.  the file should simply be named _report.md_ or _report.docx_.  No other filenames should be used.

### 1. Introduction (50-100 words)

Start by introducing the report. Describe the algorithms you chose and why you picked each one.

### 2. Datasets (100 words)

Describe the types of data set you used to test the algorithms.  Why did you pick these?  The project description said that this was an area in which you could be creative.  Demonstrate how imaginative you were in the choice of data sets. 

### 3. Algorithm Performance (450-550 Words)

Based on the data sets you described in the previous section, comment on the performance of the three algorithms you chose.  You should include things like:

1. What happened to each algorithm's performance as the number of elements in the data sets grew?
2. What happened when you used different types of data (partially sorted, reverse sorted etc.) as well as other arrangements of the data you experimented with.
3. Describe the circumstances where each of the algorithms performed best and worst.  Why do you think this to be the case?

### 4. Negatives (100 words)

Describe aspects of your implementation and/or testing which you feel could be improved.  In other words: What did you get wrong and what do you feel needs to be improved upon in terms of your code, choice of data-set and analysis.

### 5. Conclusion and Future Work (100 Words)

Bring the report to a conclusion by summarising your findings.  Give 2 things which you would do if you had more time, or if you wished to continue this analysis on beyond its current state.
## Video  Report

If you choose to submit a video you can use any device you wish to record it.  You could:

1. Record a video and upload to Youtube.  If you do this, then set the video to "unlisted."
2. use Powerpoint with embedded audio and save as MP4.
3. Record a video and save as MP4.  Zoom can be used for this if you wish.  You may also use your phone.

If you save as MP4, upload the finished video to Google Drive and share the link.  Note that DCU staff and students are on different domains, so check the permissions before submitting.  The lecturer will simply not have the time to follow up with individual students if their video links do not work, and (withoutexception) it will simply not be graded.  the link you are sharing should simply be added to the _readme.md_ file located in the _report_ folder of your gitlab repository.  Note that no other locations will be checked for this.

Don't be too worried about the visual quality.  Make sure the audio is clear.  Also, plan what you wish to say in advance.  Don't simply start the video and talk in a "stream of consciousness" (as it were) as this rarely results in high-quality content.

### 1. Introduction (20-30 seconds)

Start by introducing the report. Describe the algorithms you chose and why you picked each one.

### 2. Datasets (20-30 seconds)

Describe the types of data set you used to test the algorithms.  Why did you pick these?  The project description said that this was an area in which you could be creative.  Demonstrate how imaginative you were in the choice of data sets. 

### 3. Algorithm Performance (60-90 seconds)

Based on the data sets you described in the previous section, comment on the performance of the three algorithms you chose.  You should include things like:

1. What happened to each algorithm's performance as the number of elements in the data sets grew?
2. What happened when you used different types of data (partially sorted, reverse sorted etc.) as well as other arrangements of the data you experimented with.
3. Describe the circumstances where each of the algorithms performed best and worst.  Why do you think this to be the case?

### 4. Negatives (20-30 seconds)

Describe aspects of your implementation and/or testing which you feel could be improved.  In other words: What did you get wrong and what do you feel needs to be improved upon in terms of your code, choice of data-set and analysis.

### 5. Conclusion and Future Work (20-30 seconds)

Bring the report to a conclusion by summarising your findings.  Give 2 things which you would do if you had more time, or if you wished to continue this analysis on beyond its current state.
