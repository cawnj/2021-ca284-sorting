# 2021-ca284-sorting

## Introduction

This repo was a project for one of my modules in university worth 50% of my grade. This took me approximately two weeks and I had gone through many iterations before resulting in something I was happy with. The grade I got for this was 90% so I am quite happy with how I did.

## Goal

The main goal of the project was to create a program to sort large amount of data using different algorithms and recording how long it would take for different algorithms to complete this task.

## Usage

### To create dataset
`rng [n]`  
Where n is the number of random numbers to generate

### To sort the data and output time taken
```
Usage: sort -s/m/r [filename]
Options:
-h               Print help and exit.
-s               Use selection sort.
-m               Use merge sort.
-r               Use radix sort.
```
